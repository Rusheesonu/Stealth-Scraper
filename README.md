## üéØ Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Enter Target URL**: Input the website URL you want to scrape
2. **Define XPath Selectors**: Specify XPath expressions for the data you want to extract
3. **Execute Scraping**: Click the scrape button to start data extraction
4. **View Results**: Extracted data appears in real-time in the results panel

### XPath Examples

Here are some common XPath patterns you can use:

```xpath
# Page Title
//title/text()

# All headings
//h1 | //h2 | //h3

# Product information (e-commerce example)
//div[@class='product-title']/text()          # Product title
//span[@class='price']/text()                 # Price
//div[@class='description']/p/text()          # Description

# Links
//a/@href                                     # All link URLs
//a[contains(@class, 'button')]/text()       # Button text

# Images
//img/@src                                    # Image sources
//img/@alt                                    # Image alt text

# Tables
//table//tr//td/text()                       # All table cell text
//table//th/text()                           # Table headers
```

### Supported Websites

The scraper works with most websites, including:
- E-commerce sites (Amazon, eBay, etc.)
- News websites
- Blog posts
- Product catalogs
- Social media (public content)
- Documentation sites

## üîß Configuration

The application supports various configuration options:

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
PUPPETEER_ARGS=--no-sandbox,--disable-setuid-sandbox
TIMEOUT=30000
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=5
```

### Stealth Features

The scraper includes several anti-detection features:
- User-agent rotation
- Viewport randomization
- Request header manipulation
- JavaScript execution delays
- Cookie and session management

## üö® Usage Guidelines

### Legal and Ethical Considerations

- **Respect robots.txt**: Always check and respect website robots.txt files
- **Rate Limiting**: Don't overwhelm servers with too many requests
- **Terms of Service**: Review and comply with website terms of service
- **Personal Data**: Be mindful of scraping personal or sensitive information
- **Copyright**: Respect copyright and intellectual property rights

### Best Practices

- Add delays between requests to avoid being blocked
- Use appropriate user agents
- Handle errors gracefully
- Cache results when possible
- Monitor for website structure changes

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Scraping fails with timeout error
**Solution**: Increase timeout value or check if the website is accessible

**Issue**: Empty results returned
**Solution**: Verify XPath selectors using browser developer tools

**Issue**: Bot detection triggered
**Solution**: Reduce request frequency and check if additional stealth measures are needed

**Issue**: Memory issues with large datasets
**Solution**: Implement pagination or reduce the scope of data extraction
